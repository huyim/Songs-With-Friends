    <p>
      Users need a Spotify Premium account to use this app.  Sorry, that's how it is.  Fortunately Premium is free
      for three months, then $4.99/mo for students thereafter. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This app will only work if you, the user, have a playback device (phone, speaker, laptop browser window)
      already logged into your Spotify Premium account. 
      For instance, first go to Spotify, log in, and go to the home screen so that the Web player is running. 
      Play a bit of something so Spotify identifies the player as your most recently used device. 
      Then click the button below.  
      Don't click the button before you have a Spotify player ready to go. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To make this work nicer, your app should probably begin with an AJAX query to the server to get it
      to check with Spotify to see if 
      there is an available playback device 
      (eg. <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/player/get-information-about-the-users-current-playback/">
      here</a> or <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/player/get-a-users-available-devices/">
      here</a>). 
    </p>
    
    
    <!-- login to Spotify by redirecting to this route on the Server -->
    <a id="justConnect" href="/auth/spotify">Connect to your Spotify player</a>
    
    <p>
      Right now the user plays tracks by pusing buttons, that redirect to routes on the Server. 
      But ultimately, we'll want the Server to play the same song for all users, all at the same time.
